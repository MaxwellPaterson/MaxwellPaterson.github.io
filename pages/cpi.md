# Relationship Between CPI, Labor Force Characteristics and Opioid Deaths in Canada

This project was created by myself, Bobbi Boyce, Kennedy Gunderson and  Noah Seminoff. 

All of the analysis was completed using Python.

Libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, Datetime, Sqlalchemy, Matplotlib, Plotly and Statsmodels

### Goal

The goal of this project was to take four datasets and create a data model to connect them all together so that analysis using multiple datasources at once was possible. This was an introduction to data modelling and how to use primary and foreign keys to connect data bases together correctly. We also implemented the use of SQL in order to join and pull data from the tables we were using.

### Process

Due to the number of datasets being used in this project lots of the work done at the start was cleaning the datasets and ensuring that they would be able to seamlessly connect to eachother without formatting issues. After cleaning the datasets we began to use SQL to draw data from the singular datasets in order to draw insights from the data. The following SQL query was an example of one of these queries were we wanted to find the quarters that had more than average deaths due to opioids.

This project gave us lots of hands on practice using SQL through python, utilizing the Sqlalchemy library.
