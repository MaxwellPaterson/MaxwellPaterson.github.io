## The Project

I created this project for a position I was at where the manager wanted an easy way to view metrics of each of the buildings that we had in our database. I learned a lot in this excel project and I will highlight those things. I think that this project is interesting because all of the graphs and metrics run off of one excel sheet. This excel sheet dynamically changes as you choose different buildings and runs off just the raw data sheet. This made it possible for me to have a quite complex dashboard with lots of metrics and the ability to change which building you are looking at without creating hundreds of static metrics for each and every building possible.

Due to privacy reasons all the numbers and names in this project have been changed and do not represent the actual emmisions or usages of any buildings.
