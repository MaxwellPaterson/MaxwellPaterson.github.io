## About Me
Hello and welcome to my portfolio, thank you for taking the time to look at my work! Outside of Data Science and Analytics, I enjoy reading a wide range of genres. While I primarily focus on history and nonfiction, I also enjoy fantasy books. I'm currently working my way through the Game of Thrones series. Additionally, I love spending time outdoors, hiking and camping are some of my favorite activities. In the winter, I especially enjoy cross-country skiing. And if your a potential employer ignore all those activities I only *LOVE* Data Science and Analytics... <sub>sorry mom</sub>

## Excel Projects

Tableau and Power BI laugh in the face of excel and its capabilities when it comes to creating dashboards. However, sometimes Excel is what you are given to complete a certain project and all it takes is a bit of creativity to get there (aka thousands of unresolved google searches). I really do believe that being creative and coming up with interesting solutions to problems is a big part of Data Science and although Excel is not the fanciest program to use I am proud of the projects that I have created using it.
